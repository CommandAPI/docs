### Default namespace changes

The default namespace has been updated from `minecraft` to the plugin's name. If you are not shading, the default namespace is going to be `commandapi`. If you are shading, the default namespace is going to be your plugin's name.

Along with this change, the `CommandAPIBukkitConfig#usePluginNamespace()` has been deprecated since it is now default behaviour.
