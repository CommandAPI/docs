`NativeProxyCommandSender` used to be a class, but this version changed it to an interface. Any code compiled against an earlier version that references any method of `NativeProxyCommandSender` may throw the following `IncompatibleClassChangeError` when run using the new version of the API:

```
java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Found interface dev.jorel.commandapi.wrappers.NativeProxyCommandSender, but class was expected
```

If this happens, the original code simply needs to be recompiled using the new API version.

Additionally, the constructor of `NativeProxyCommandSender` is no longer available. Instead, the static `from` method should be used:

```java
new NativeProxyCommandSender(caller, callee, location, world); // [!code --]

NativeProxyCommandSender.from(caller, callee, location, world); // [!code ++]
```
