### Deprecated methods

For 10.0.0, all previously deprecated methods have been removed. Please make sure you use the replacement methods for the deprecated methods. The replacement methods should be described in the JavaDocs of deprecated methods.

### Default namespace changes

The default namespace has been updated from `minecraft` to the plugin's name. If you are not shading, the default namespace is going to be `commandapi`. If you are shading, the default namespace is going to be your plugin's name.

Along with this change, the `CommandAPIBukkitConfig#usePluginNamespace()` has been deprecated since it is now default behaviour.

### `NativeProxyCommandSender` changes

`NativeProxyCommandSender` used to be a class, but this version changed it to an interface. Any code compiled against an earlier version that references any method of `NativeProxyCommandSender` may throw the following `IncompatibleClassChangeError` when run using the new version of the API:

```
java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Found interface dev.jorel.commandapi.wrappers.NativeProxyCommandSender, but class was expected
```

If this happens, the original code simply needs to be recompiled using the new API version.

Additionally, the constructor of `NativeProxyCommandSender` is no longer available. Instead, the static `from` method should be used:

```java
new NativeProxyCommandSender(caller, callee, location, world); // [!code --]

NativeProxyCommandSender.from(caller, callee, location, world); // [!code ++]
```
